                Shiraz (/ʃɪəˈrɑːz/ (About this soundlisten); Persian: شیراز, (About this
                soundlisten)) is the fourth-most-populous city of Iran and the capital of Fars Province, which is also known
                as Pars (پارس, Pārs) and Persis (Persia). At the 2016 census, the population of the city was 1,869,001 and
                its built-up area with "Shahr-e Jadid-e Sadra" (Sadra New Town) was home to 1,565,572 inhabitants. Shiraz is
                located in the southwest of Iran on the "Rudkhaneye Khoshk" (The Dry River) seasonal river. It has a moderate
                climate and has been a regional trade center for over a thousand years. Shiraz is one of the oldest cities of
                ancient Persia.
            </p>
            <p>
                The earliest reference to the city, as Tiraziš, is on Elamite clay tablets dated to 2000 BC. The modern city
                was founded or restored by the Umayyads in 693 and grew prominent under the successive Iranian Saffarid and
                Buyid dynasties in the 9th and 10th–11th centuries, respectively. In the 13th century, Shiraz became a leading
                center of the arts and letters, due to the encouragement of its ruler and the presence of many Persian scholars
                and artists. It was the capital of Persia during the Zand dynasty from 1750 until 1800. Two famous poets of
                Iran, Hafez and Saadi, are from Shiraz, whose tombs are on the north side of the current city boundaries.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shiraz is known as the city of poets, literature, and flowers. It is also considered by many Iranians to
                be the city of gardens, due to the many gardens, and fruit trees that can be seen in the city, such as Eram
                Garden. Shiraz has had major Jewish and Christian communities. The crafts of Shiraz consist of inlaid mosaic
                work of triangular design; silver-ware; pile carpet-weaving and weaving of kilim, called gilim and jajim in the
                villages and among the tribes. In Shiraz industries such as cement production, sugar, fertilizers, textile
                products, wood products, metalwork, and rugs dominate. Shirāz also has a major oil refinery and
                is a major center for Iran's electronic industries: 53% of Iran's electronic investment has been centered in
                Shiraz. Shiraz is home to Iran's first solar power plant. Recently the city's first wind turbine has
                been installed above Babakuhi mountain near the city.

                <h3 >Pre-Islamic era</h3>
                <p>
                    Though, there is no definitive record of its existence prior to the late 7th century CE, few archaeological
                    finds dating from 1933 and beyond indicate that the site or vicinity of Shiraz was likely settled in the
                    pre-Islamic era as early as the 6th century BCE. A number of Sasanian-era remains have been discovered
                    around the city, including reliefs at Barm-e Delak to the east and Guyim to the northwest, and ruins of Sasanian
                    fortresses at Qasr-e Abu Nasr to the east and Fahandezh. The latter is identified with the fortress of
                    Shahmobad mentioned as being in Shiraz by the 10th-century geographical work, Hudud al-'alam. The names
                    "Tirrazish" and "Shirrazish" were found on Elamite tablets in Persepolis, while Sasanian and early Islamic-era
                    clay seals found at Qasr-e-Abu Nasr mention the name "Shiraz" alongside the name of the Sasanian administrative
                    district of the area, Ardashir-Khwarrah. According to the diplomat and academic John Limbert, this indicates
                    that the name "Shiraz" is traced back to the Elamite "Shirrazish" and that both refer to a settlement that
                    existed at the site of Qasr-e-Abu Nasr. This settlement prospered between the 6th and 8th-centuries CE and
                    was possibly the administrative center for the Shiraz plain until the modern city of Shiraz was founded.
                    Nonetheless, the lack of references to Shiraz in early Persian sources suggests the city could not have been
                    more than a way-station in the plain in which it lays.

                <h3>Early Islamic era</h3>
                <p>
                    The present city of Shiraz was founded or restored in 693 by Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Thaqafi, the brother of the
                    Umayyad viceroy of the eastern half of the caliphate, al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, or the latter's kinsman Muhammad ibn
                    Qasim. The Arab Muslim army had conquered the wider region of Fars, where the site of Shiraz is located,
                    in several expeditions launched from their garrison town of Basra between 640 and 653, and specifically captured
                    the immediate area around Shiraz early on, in 641. This area did not possess any cities, though there were a
                    number of forts which were forced to pay tribute to the Arabs. The Sasanians held firm in Istakhr, their
                    capital in Fars, until the Arabs captured it in a heavy battle in 653, during which the plain of Shiraz had been
                    utilized as an Arab campground. Because of Istakhr's deep association with the Sasanian Empire and the
                    Zoroastrian religion, the Arabs sought to establish in nearby Shiraz a rival cultural and administrative
                    center. Thus, during its initial founding in 693, the city was planned to be much larger than Isfahan.
                    However, the initial ambitions were not realized and Shiraz remained a "provincial backwater" in the shadow of
                    Istakhr until at least the late 9th century, according to Limbert. This is partly attributed to the
                    reticence of the largely Zoroastrian population of Fars to inhabit the Islamic Arab city. As the population
                    gradually shifted to Islam from Zoroastrianism and Istakhr concurrently declined, Shiraz grew into the practical
                    center of Fars.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to Muslim traditional sources, Shiraz was used as a hideout by three of the brothers of the Shia
                    Muslim imam Ali al-Ridha following the latter's death in 817/18 and later by one of the brothers' sons, Ali ibn
                    Hamza ibn Musa, until he was found and executed by the Abbasid authorities in circa 835. As Abbasid
                    authority waned during this period, regional dynasties emerged with considerable autonomy. In the late 9th
                    century, the Iranian Muslim Saffarid dynasty under Ya'qub ibn al-Layth made Shiraz the capital of their
                    autonomous state, which encompassed most of modern-day Iran. In 894, Ya'qub's brother and successor,
                    Amr, founded the city's first congregational mosque, today known as the Atigh Jame' Mosque.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Iranian Buyid dynasty under Imad al-Dawla Ali ibn Buya ousted the Saffarids in 933 and his nephew and
                    successor, 'Adud al-Dawla Fana Khusraw, took over and ruled Fars between 949 and 983, and added Iraq, the seat
                    of the Abbasid Caliphate, to his Shiraz-based domains in 977; the Abbasids thenceforth became a puppet state
                    of the Shiraz-based dynasty. Shiraz developed into the largest and most prosperous city of Fars and an
                    important economic and cultural center of the caliphate. Adud al-Dawla had a large library, a hospital
                    and several mosques, bazaars, caravanserais, palaces and gardens built in the city, while south of it he erected
                    a fortified camp for his troops, known as Kard Fana Khusraw, in 974. One of the congregational mosques
                    built by Adud al-Dawla has survived until the present day. Two Zoroastrian fire temples also existed in
                    Shiraz, catering to the Persians who had not converted to Islam. One of Adud al-Dawla's palaces
                    stretched out for nearly three miles and consisted of 360 rooms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under the Buyids, Shiraz was divided into twelve quarters and had eight gates. It owed its economic
                    prosperity to the booming agricultural trade of Fars. The city largely consumed the agricultural products of
                    the province, including grapes, linen, wool, cotton, collyrium, rose, violet and palm-blossom water. It was
                    also a market for rug weavers and painters to sell their pricey products, a testament to the residents'
                    wealth. At the time, wine, grains, gold and silver were exported from the Farsi port cities of Siraf and
                    Najairam. Adud al-Dawla patronized scientific, medical and Islamic religious research in Shiraz.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The city was spared destruction by the invading Mongols, when its local ruler offered tributes and submission to
                    Genghis Khan. Shiraz was again spared by Tamerlane, when in 1382 the local monarch, Shah Shoja agreed to submit
                    to the invader. In the 13th century, Shiraz became a leading center of the arts and letters, thanks to the
                    encouragement of its ruler and the presence of many Persian scholars and artists. For this reason the city was
                    named by classical geographers Dar al-'Elm, the House of Knowledge. Among the Iranian poets, mystics and
                    philosophers born in Shiraz were the poets Sa'di and Hafiz, the mystic Ruzbehan, and the philosopher
                    Mulla Sadra. Thus Shiraz has been nicknamed "The Athens of Iran". As early as the 11th century, several
                    hundred thousand people inhabited Shiraz. In the 14th century Shiraz had sixty thousand inhabitants.
                    During the 16th century it had a population of 200,000 people, which by the mid-18th century had decreased to
                    only 55,000.

            <div id="safavidEra">
                <h3>Safavid era</h3>
                <p>
                    In 1504, Shiraz was captured by the forces of Ismail I, the founder of the Safavid dynasty. Throughout the
                    Safavid empire (1501–1722) Shiraz remained a provincial capital and Emam Qoli Khan, the governor of Fars under
                    Shah Abbas I, constructed many palaces and ornate buildings in the same style as those built during the same
                    period in Isfahan, the capital of the Empire. After the fall of the Safavids, Shiraz suffered a period of
                    decline, worsened by the raids of the Afghans and the rebellion of its governor against Nader Shah; the latter
                    sent troops to suppress the revolt. The city was besieged for many months and eventually sacked. At the time of
                    Nader Shah's murder in 1747, most of the historical buildings of the city were damaged or ruined, and its
                    population fell to 50,000, one-quarter of that during the 16th century.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shiraz soon returned to prosperity under the rule of Karim Khan Zand, who made it his capital in 1762. Employing
                    more than 12,000 workers, he constructed a royal district with a fortress, many administrative buildings, a
                    mosque, and one of the finest covered bazaars in Iran. He had a moat built around the city, constructed an
                    irrigation and drainage system, and rebuilt the city walls. However, Karim Khan's heirs failed to secure his
                    gains. When Agha Mohammad Khan, the founder of the Qajar dynasty, eventually came to power, he wreaked his
                    revenge on Shiraz by destroying the city's fortifications and moving the national capital to Tehran.
                    Although lowered to the rank of a provincial capital, Shiraz maintained a level of prosperity as a result of the
                    continuing importance of the trade route to the Persian Gulf. Its governorship was a royal prerogative
                    throughout the Qajar dynasty. Many of the famous gardens, buildings and residences built during this time
                    contribute to the city's present skyline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shiraz is the birthplace of the co-founder of the Baháʼí Faith, the Báb (Siyyid 'Ali-Muhammad, 1819–1850). In
                    this city, on the evening of 22 May 1844, he first declared his mission as the bearer of a new divine
                    revelation. For this reason Shiraz is a holy city for Baháʼís, and the city, particularly the house of the
                    Báb, was identified as a place of pilgrimage. Due to the hostile climate towards Baháʼís in Iran, the house
                    has been the target of repeated attacks; the house was destroyed in 1979, to be paved over two years later and
                    made into a public square.

                    In 1910, a pogrom of the Jewish quarter started after false rumours that the Jews had ritually murdered a Muslim
                    girl. In the course of the riots, 12 Jews were murdered and about 50 were injured, and the 6,000 Jews of Shiraz
                    were robbed of all their possessions.

                <p>
                    During the Pahlavi dynasty, Shiraz became the center of attention again. Many important landmarks like Tombs of
                    Poets' such as Sa'di and Hafiz, were constructed and presented to the public.

                <p>
                    Lacking any great industrial, religious or strategic importance, Shiraz became an administrative center,
                    although its population has nevertheless grown considerably since the 1979 revolution.

                    The city's municipality and other related institutions have initiated restoration and reconstruction
                    projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of the most recent projects have been the complete restoration of the Arg of Karim Khan and of the Vakil
                    Bath, as well as a comprehensive plan for the preservation of the old city quarters. Other noteworthy
                    initiatives include the total renovation of the Qur'an Gate and the mausoleum of the poet Khwaju Kermani, both
                    located in the Allah-u-Akbar Gorge, as well as the restoration and expansion of the mausoleum of the famous
                    Shiraz-born poets Hafiz and Saadi.
                </p>
                <p>

                    After the Iranian Revolution, Shiraz was re-established as the capital of Iranian Art and Culture among the
                    people. Shiraz is known as the capital of Persian Art, Culture and Literature. However, the current
                    government has tried to re-brand the city as "Sevomin haram-e ahle beit" meaning "Third home of Saints"
                    referring to the Shahcheragh shrine and some other holy places in the city.
